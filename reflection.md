Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a pizza restaurant and basically has different methods that an employee uses when they are working at the restaurant. The grab() and drop() methods indicate when an employee grabs an ingredient off the pizza and when they drop one on the pizza. examine() represents when an employee examines if an item is still good and use() is when an employee uses an ingredient and then has to remove it from a list of ingredients. walk() is when an employee walks to different locations. fly() and shrink() represent throwing the dough in the air to stretch it and shrinking it by pounding it down and grow() is when the pizza is in the oven and the crust grows. undo() makes the dough back into a ball after it has been pounded. rest() is when the employee is going on break and is resting. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
None

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would say that this assignment is pretty simple if you can understand that all you need to do is just have the 10 required methods in your class and that they can do basically anything you want them to.
